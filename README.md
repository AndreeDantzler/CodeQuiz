# CodeQuiz

## Description

Welcome to the Code Quiz!

I was tasked with creating a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It should have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

### Acceptance Criteria

```

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score


```
